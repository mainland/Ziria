-- | Monadic map over a telescope
--
-- A /telescope/ is a list of binding sites where later items in the list
-- can refer to earlier items the list. A typical example is a list of
-- parameters, where we might have
--
-- > fun comp f(arr int x, arr[length(x)] int y) { .. }
--
-- Typically when we map over a telescope we want to map each subsequent
-- in some sort of environment that records all previous elements. We
-- abstract over this pattenr here.
